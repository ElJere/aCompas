# A Comp√°s

A flamenco metronome available in two versions :

* Web application (available at [http://acompas.audio](http://acompas.audio)).
* Mobile application using [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/), [available on the Google Play marketplace](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=audio.acompas.app).

It makes use of Web Audio API to play various flamenco rhythms and features a visual animation.

## Installing the web application (the simple way)

```bash
# Clone the git repository in the current folder
git clone https://github.com/ElJere/aCompas.git
# Go inside the folder created by the previous command
cd aCompas
# Install dependencies using bower
bower install
# Synchronize assets to the web/ and crosswalk/ folders
./sync_assets.sh
# Run a basic web server on port 8000
./server.sh
```

Then, open your favorite web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Installing the web application (the vagrant way)

Get the latest version of vagrant at `https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html`

Then in the project folder 

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ElJere/aCompas.git
